class Shape():
    r"""
    This class provides a canonical representation of a shape function independently of the way in which the user specified the shape. It assumes a differential equation of the general form (where bracketed superscript :math:`{}^{(n)}` indicates the :math:`n`-th derivative with respect to time):

    .. math::

       x^{(n)} = N + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i x^{(i)}

    Any constant or nonlinear part is here contained in the term N.

    In the input and output, derivatives are indicated by adding one prime (single quotation mark) for each derivative order. For example, in the expression

    ::

       x''' = c0*x + c1*x' + c2*x'' + x*y + x**2

    the :python:`symbol` of the ODE would be :python:`x` (i.e. without any qualifiers), :python:`order` would be 3, :python:`derivative_factors` would contain the linear part in the form of the list :python:`[c0, c1, c2]`, and the nonlinear part :python:`x*y + x**2` is stored in :python:`diff_rhs_derivatives`.
